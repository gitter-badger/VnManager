A program to keep track of your visual novels

This repository was also renamed from Visual-Novel-Manager-v2 to VnManager

The source for the "Visual-Novel-Manager-v2" can be found under the v2-archive branch, found here:

I am currently working on a rewrite of the application, so I won't have any more fixes to the old one for now.
