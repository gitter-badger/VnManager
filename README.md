A program to keep track of your visual novels

I'm currently working on the v3 branch, so master will be empty until it's at least in a usable form when I can merge it over.

This repository was also renamed from Visual-Novel-Manager-v2 to VnManager

The source for the "Visual-Novel-Manager-v2" can be found under the v2-archive branch, found here:
[Visual-Novel-Manager-v2](https://github.com/micah686/VnManager/tree/v2-archive)

I am currently working on a rewrite of the application, so I won't have any more fixes to the old one for now.
